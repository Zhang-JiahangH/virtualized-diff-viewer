# react-virtualized-diff

Built for large files: a virtualized React diff component.

## At a Glance

- ⚡ **Focus:** fast diff rendering for very large files (10k+ lines).
- 🧩 **Best for:** embedded PR/MR review pages, long-list diff UIs, and internal review tools.
- 🧭 **Positioning details:** [docs/positioning.md](./docs/positioning.md).

## Positioning

Target scenarios: very large files, long-list scrolling experiences, and embedded code review pages (PR/MR diff views) where stable first paint and smooth scrolling are critical.

| Option | Performance (large files) | Bundle size | Customizability | React ecosystem integration cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `react-virtualized-diff` | High (virtualized rendering for 10k+ lines) | Small-to-medium (focused diff capability) | High (style slots, render hooks, interaction callbacks) | Low (native React API, TypeScript-friendly) |
| Traditional non-virtualized diff components | Medium-to-low (often degrades on big files) | Medium | Medium (limited extension points) | Low (quick to adopt, but needs extra optimization for large files) |
| In-house diff + virtualization | Depends on implementation (can be high) | Uncertain (often grows with business logic) | High (fully controllable) | High (build + maintenance overhead) |

High-performance React code/text diff viewer for **large text/code files** with virtualized rendering.

## Why react-virtualized-diff

Most diff components are smooth for small files, but degrade heavily with 10k+ lines.

`react-virtualized-diff` is built for:

- **Virtualized rendering** for big-file performance
- **Side-by-side layout** for easy review
- **Collapsed unchanged blocks** with configurable context
- **TypeScript support** for predictable integration

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add react-virtualized-diff
# or npm i react-virtualized-diff
# or yarn add react-virtualized-diff
```

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { DiffViewer } from 'react-virtualized-diff';

const original = `line 1\nline 2\nline 3`;
const modified = `line 1\nline 2 changed\nline 3\nline 4`;

export function App() {
  return (
    <DiffViewer
      original={original}
      modified={modified}
      contextLines={2}
      height={480}
    />
  );
}
```
